    <p>
      Rails Camp is a full-weekend retreat for people interested in
      web development to gather and be awesome together.
      People attend for a variety of reasons:
      socialising, hacking, learning, teaching, drinking, gaming, and more.
      Though there is a focus on Ruby,
      we welcome anyone interested in programming or web technologies to join us.
